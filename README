**** About the tlswebprober ****

The tlswebprober is a web service version of the TLS Prober, allowing
testing of individual TLS servers, supporting HTTPS, IMAP, POP, or SMTP,
with a presentation of the results afterwards.

The tool is based on the Django framework (only tested in Django 1.1), 
and is deployed on a HTTP server using the standard Django deployment 
procedures described at 

  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.1/howto/deployment/>
  
using tlswebprober.webprober.settings as the settings module.

In the deployed path, the following URLs are defined

  /     	:	Main query page. The "Server" field will accept, and parse a full URL
  				The form submits to /doprobe
  /doprobe	:	Performs a probe of the designated server , and displays the results
  				Accepts POST or GET queries 

  				
Requirements:

 - Python 2.6 or later
 - Django 1.1 or later
 - M2Crypto
